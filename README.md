# HTML
A PHP Object Oriented approach to creating HTML

This project started as a thought experiment initially, but has since proven to be rather handy.  The experiment was simply to take an approach to writing HTML content from within PHP as a purely object oriented endeavor.

Although some tags like `<br>` or `<p>` don't see big gains from this approach usually, handling more complex tags like anchors, images, forms and tables can see some benefits.

At this time the list of objects is far from complete.  As I'm populating this repository I'm insuring that every new class is fully unit tested and this project is readily able to be included via PHP Composer.  Along the way I've been adjusting, tweaking, trimming down the code to make it easier to read and more consistent to use.
